##Usage Instructions
Welcome to the first part of my POE, I will be explaining how to properly go through my application to ensure you enjoy.
Once you open the application press 1 to begin entering your recipe.
Understanding how to enter ingredients:
Ingredients will be stored in 3 parts. Ingredient name, unit of measurement and quanity of the ingredient.
This is how you should enter "2 table spoons of sugar".
	Sugar is the name of the ingredient, 2 is the quantity of the ingredient and table spoons is the unit of measurement.

When the application asks you a question please only respond with the given options, as they are typed. 
If you eneter the incorrect data type the application will guide you to answer appropriatley, only the correct answer will be stored.
For example, when asked
	- Would you like to have the recipe made to a different scale? Enter '1' for yes or any other integer to return to the menu.
If you enter 'return to menu' or any other string you will be prompted to enter an integer.
If you enter a integer that is not '1', you will be returned back to the menu where you can choose which method you would like to use to interact with the recipe.

You are now ready to enjoy my application, I hope you enjoy.
